<p>No. From the RIOT point of view the Raspberry PI is a supercomputer. RIOT targets mostly systems that are too constrained to run Linux (less than 1MB of RAM, no MMU). However, it is supported to run <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Family:-native">RIOT native</a> on platforms like the Raspberry PI, and other hardware supported by Linux or BSD.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb concerning RIOT support of a particular board is: can Linux support this board? If yes, then you should ask yourself <em>why</em> you really want to use RIOT (other than <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Family:-native">native</a>) on this board. If no, then RIOT support is probably desirable.</p>
