<p>Log an issue in GitHub. Then post to the mailing list devel@riot-os.org and/or users@riot-os.org.
For critical vulnerabilities we would appreciate you to report them with a 90 day heads-up to security@riot-os.org first, before making them publicly available.
You’re also welcome to ask in the IRC channel #riot-os at <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net">freenode.net</a>, but don’t be disappointed if everyone there is busy. It is also a very good idea to search our <a href="https://forum.riot-os.org">forum</a>.</p>
